# CS230

The client was called The Gaming Room and they were a game development team that wanted to bring their game, Draw It Or Lose It, to other platforms. They wanted us to design a game that could work for mobile development.

I did a particularly good job of identifying the pros and cons of our recommendations, and walking the client through that without technical jargon.

Working through a design document made coding easier because we had already identified what exactly needed to be worked on. It made my code more specific, and cleaner. 

I would revise my evalulation section, because I think it could have been more in depth. I could have analyzed with more a focus on the context the end product would be in. 

I interpreted the user's needs via the executive overview and design constraints section. I implemented them into the design by using the patterns the company identified as something they wanted, or the patterns that would be required to meet their needs (i.e. singleton and iterator pattern). It's important to keep their needs in mind, because the user's needs define the whole thing. A great product is great, but it's functionally useless if it doesn't work for the people it was designed to work for.

I approached it by identifying the user's needs, and then figuring out what tecnniques would be needed to implement that. I also used a UML diagram, which made understanding what went where for which classes much easier. Going forward, I would always use a UML diagram, and do an executive overview and design constraints section to make sure I am meeting the client's needs, and the needs of the end user.
